This is a test. I haven't done blogging before, and I'm also new with this framework.

### Pokemon GO

I do play Pokemon GO. My favourite Pokemon are Aggron and Togedemaru.

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
